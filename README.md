#Wireless Sensor Network
An algorithm for determining a selection of bipartite subgraphs that are produced by an algorithm for graph coloring in a random geometric Graph (RGG). These results model a wireless sensor network (WSN) with each bipartite subgraph providing a communication backbone. Part I is to prepare several RGG’s as a randomized benchmark set. RGG’s on the unit square, and RGG's on a disk (unit circle) model WSN’s on geographic regions.  RGG’s on the whole sphere model WSN’s that span the globe. 

Part II is coloring by smallest last ordering combined sequential coloring.

Part III is bipartite selection

It includes RGG and bipartite visulization, statistical information and charts display.
